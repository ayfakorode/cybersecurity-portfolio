## üß¨ The Evolution of Cybersecurity

### üîπ What is Malware?
- Malware is software designed to harm devices or networks.
- Originally, malicious code was called **viruses** that required a host file to spread.
- Today, malware includes viruses, worms, ransomware, spyware, etc.

### üß† Notable Malware Attacks

- **The Brain Virus (1986):**
  - Created to prevent piracy of medical software.
  - Infected boot sectors of floppy disks and spread unknowingly between computers.
  - Slowed down systems and impacted productivity.

- **The Morris Worm (1988):**
  - Intended to measure the size of the internet.
  - Due to a flaw, it reinstalled itself multiple times, overloading systems and crashing ~6,000 computers (10% of the internet at the time).

- **The ILOVEYOU Virus (2000):**
  - Disguised as a love letter email attachment.
  - When opened, it forwarded itself to the user‚Äôs contacts and harvested PII.
  - Affected ~45 million computers globally.

## üß† Social Engineering

Social engineering is a manipulation tactic used to exploit human error to gain private information or access.

### Types of Social Engineering:
- **Phishing:** Trick users through email or messages to reveal sensitive data or install malware.
- **Vishing:** Voice-based phishing via calls.
- **Smishing:** SMS/text-based phishing.
- **Spear Phishing:** Targeted phishing to specific individuals or organizations.
- **Whaling:** Spear phishing that targets high-level executives.
- **BEC (Business Email Compromise):** Fraudulent email pretending to be a known source to trick users into transferring money or sensitive data.

### Psychological Principles Exploited:
- **Authority:** Pretending to be a boss or government figure.
- **Intimidation:** Pressuring victims through fear or urgency.
- **Consensus/Social Proof:** ‚ÄúOthers have done this, so should you.‚Äù
- **Scarcity:** ‚ÄúThis is a limited-time opportunity.‚Äù
- **Familiarity:** Pretending to know or have a connection with the target.
- **Trust:** Building a fake relationship over time.
- **Urgency:** Forcing quick action to bypass rational thought.

## üõ°Ô∏è Malware Overview

### Common Malware Types:
- **Viruses:** Attach to files, require user action to activate.
- **Worms:** Spread independently across networks without user interaction.
- **Ransomware:** Encrypts data and demands payment for decryption.
- **Spyware:** Secretly collects personal info (emails, texts, locations).

## üî• Incident Response Mentality

> ‚ÄúBe like a firefighter.‚Äù  
- Stay calm during a data breach.
- Follow your **incident response plan**.
- Focus on containment and communication, not panic.

## üìÇ Threat Actor Types

### üë§ APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats)
- Highly skilled, well-funded.
- Stealthy, long-term access to networks.
- Motives: critical infrastructure disruption, IP theft, espionage.

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Insider Threats
- Authorized users who misuse their access.
- Motives: sabotage, personal gain, revenge.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Hacktivists
- Politically or socially motivated attackers.
- Use digital tools for protest, propaganda, or fame.

## üíª Hacker Classifications

### ‚úÖ Authorized Hackers (White Hats)
- Ethical hackers.
- Follow legal frameworks.
- Help organizations find and fix vulnerabilities.

### ‚ö™ Semi-Authorized Hackers (Researchers)
- Explore systems, but don‚Äôt exploit vulnerabilities.
- May report issues to vendors or security communities.

### ‚ùå Unauthorized Hackers (Black Hats)
- Malicious actors who break the law.
- Seek personal gain, often through theft or extortion.

> Other hacker types usually fall into one of these three core categories.
