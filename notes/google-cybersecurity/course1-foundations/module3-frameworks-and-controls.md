# 📘 Module 3: Frameworks, Laws & Ethics in Cybersecurity

---

## 🔐 Security Frameworks Overview

Security frameworks are structured guidelines used to minimize risk and protect data and privacy.

### 🔹 4 Core Components of Security Frameworks
1. Identify and document security goals  
2. Set guidelines to achieve those goals  
3. Implement strong security processes  
4. Monitor and communicate the results

### 🔹 Purpose of Frameworks
- Protect PII
- Secure financial information
- Identify weaknesses
- Manage organizational risk
- Align security with business goals

## 🛡️ CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)

- **Confidentiality:** Only authorized users can access specific data (e.g., access controls)
- **Integrity:** Data must remain accurate and untampered (e.g., hashing, encryption)
- **Availability:** Ensure systems are accessible to authorized users (e.g., uptime planning, redundancy)

## 🧰 Common Cybersecurity Frameworks & Standards

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework
Voluntary U.S. framework used to manage short- and long-term cybersecurity risks.

### FERC-NERC (Power Grid Security)
Applies to energy organizations; enforces **Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP)** standards.

### FedRAMP
U.S. federal program standardizing cloud security assessment and monitoring for government agencies and vendors.

### CIS (Center for Internet Security)
Nonprofit providing **CIS Controls** to help organizations defend against cyberattacks.

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
EU regulation protecting residents’ data privacy rights across borders.  
- Requires breach notifications within 72 hours  
- Fines for transparency failures or misuse of data

### PCI DSS
Security standard for handling credit card information. Aims to reduce card fraud.

### HIPAA
U.S. federal law protecting patients’ health information. Governed by:
- Privacy Rule
- Security Rule
- Breach Notification Rule  
Also supported by the **HITRUST Framework** for compliance assurance.

### ISO (International Organization for Standardization)
Creates international security, tech, and management standards.

### SOC 1 & SOC 2
Developed by AICPA. Assesses risk controls, access policies, and security across organizational roles.

## ⚖️ Cybersecurity Laws & Ethics

### 🔹 Security Ethics
Ethics in cybersecurity means making responsible, legal, and transparent choices.

### Ethical Principles
- **Confidentiality:** Duty to protect private data
- **Privacy Protections:** Do not disclose private data without proper authorization

### Consequences of Unethical Behavior
- Damage to professional reputation
- Legal penalties
- Violations of compliance regulations

---

## 🚫 Counterattacks & Law

### U.S. Stance
Counterattacks are **illegal** under:
- **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (1986)**
- **Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (2015)**

Only authorized government or military personnel may launch countermeasures.

### Why Counterattacks Are Discouraged
- Seen as vigilantism
- May escalate the situation
- Often illegal, hard to control, and lead to worse outcomes

### Threat Actor Example
- **Hacktivist:** Hacker with political/social motives
- **Nation-State Actor:** Could trigger international conflict

---

## 🌍 International View on Counterattacks (ICJ Guidelines)
Counterattacks are allowed if:
1. They only affect the original attacker
2. They act as a direct warning to stop
3. They don’t escalate the situation
4. Their effects can be reversed

Most organizations **avoid counterattacks** due to legal gray areas and unpredictability.

## 🧠 Ethics in Practice

Ethics frameworks (e.g., CIA Triad) are used to guide:
- Confidentiality
- Privacy
- Lawful defense

Unethical behavior often includes:
- Laziness or cutting corners
- Sharing passwords
- Unauthorized system access for personal gain

## 🧠 Reflection

> This module helped me understand that cybersecurity isn't just about tools and controls — it's about responsible behavior. Learning the laws and frameworks showed how cybersecurity actions have legal and ethical consequences. I now see how important it is to be disciplined and aware, not just technically skilled.
