## üß¨ The Evolution of Cybersecurity

### üîπ What is Malware?
- Malware is software designed to harm devices or networks.
- Originally, malicious code was called **viruses** that required a host file to spread.
- Today, malware includes viruses, worms, ransomware, spyware, etc.

### üß† Notable Malware Attacks

- **The Brain Virus (1986):**
  - Created to prevent piracy of medical software.
  - Infected boot sectors of floppy disks and spread unknowingly between computers.
  - Slowed down systems and impacted productivity.

- **The Morris Worm (1988):**
  - Intended to measure the size of the internet.
  - Due to a flaw, it reinstalled itself multiple times, overloading systems and crashing ~6,000 computers (10% of the internet at the time).

- **The ILOVEYOU Virus (2000):**
  - Disguised as a love letter email attachment.
  - When opened, it forwarded itself to the user‚Äôs contacts and harvested PII.
  - Affected ~45 million computers globally.

## üß† Social Engineering

Social engineering is a manipulation tactic used to exploit human error to gain private information or access.

### Types of Social Engineering:
- **Phishing:** Trick users through email or messages to reveal sensitive data or install malware.
- **Vishing:** Voice-based phishing via calls.
- **Smishing:** SMS/text-based phishing.
- **Spear Phishing:** Targeted phishing to specific individuals or organizations.
- **Whaling:** Spear phishing that targets high-level executives.
- **BEC (Business Email Compromise):** Fraudulent email pretending to be a known source to trick users into transferring money or sensitive data.

### Psychological Principles Exploited:
- **Authority:** Pretending to be a boss or government figure.
- **Intimidation:** Pressuring victims through fear or urgency.
- **Consensus/Social Proof:** ‚ÄúOthers have done this, so should you.‚Äù
- **Scarcity:** ‚ÄúThis is a limited-time opportunity.‚Äù
- **Familiarity:** Pretending to know or have a connection with the target.
- **Trust:** Building a fake relationship over time.
- **Urgency:** Forcing quick action to bypass rational thought.

## üõ°Ô∏è Malware Overview

### Common Malware Types:
- **Viruses:** Attach to files, require user action to activate.
- **Worms:** Spread independently across networks without user interaction.
- **Ransomware:** Encrypts data and demands payment for decryption.
- **Spyware:** Secretly collects personal info (emails, texts, locations).

---

## üî• Incident Response Mentality

> ‚ÄúBe like a firefighter.‚Äù  
- Stay calm during a data breach.
- Follow your **incident response plan**.
- Focus on containment and communication, not panic.

---

## üìÇ Threat Actor Types

### üë§ APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats)
- Highly skilled, well-funded.
- Stealthy, long-term access to networks.
- Motives: critical infrastructure disruption, IP theft, espionage.

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Insider Threats
- Authorized users who misuse their access.
- Motives: sabotage, personal gain, revenge.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Hacktivists
- Politically or socially motivated attackers.
- Use digital tools for protest, propaganda, or fame.

---

## üíª Hacker Classifications

### ‚úÖ Authorized Hackers (White Hats)
- Ethical hackers.
- Follow legal frameworks.
- Help organizations find and fix vulnerabilities.

### ‚ö™ Semi-Authorized Hackers (Researchers)
- Explore systems, but don‚Äôt exploit vulnerabilities.
- May report issues to vendors or security communities.

### ‚ùå Unauthorized Hackers (Black Hats)
- Malicious actors who break the law.
- Seek personal gain, often through theft or extortion.

> Other hacker types usually fall into one of these three core categories.

## üõ°Ô∏è CISSP Domains Overview

These are key knowledge areas from the **CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional)** framework:

1. **Security and Risk Management:** Defines policies, goals, risk mitigation, legal compliance, and business continuity.
2. **Asset Security:** Securing physical and digital assets; includes proper data disposal.
3. **Security Architecture & Engineering:** Ensures secure systems and infrastructure.
4. **Communication and Network Security:** Securing data-in-transit and network configurations.
5. **Identity and Access Management:** Controls who can access what and when.
6. **Security Assessment & Testing:** Performs audits and control testing.
7. **Security Operations:** Incident response, monitoring, investigations.
8. **Software Development Security:** Secure coding practices and lifecycle protections.

## üß† Reflection

This module helped me understand how cybersecurity has evolved over time in response to increasingly sophisticated threats. Learning about early malware like the Brain Virus and the Morris Worm gave me perspective on how far the threat landscape has come ‚Äî and how quickly attackers adapt.

What stood out to me most was how **social engineering** exploits human behavior more than technology. Understanding psychological tactics like authority, urgency, and trust made me realize that cybersecurity is not just about systems ‚Äî it's also about people.

I also found it valuable to learn the differences between **various types of malware and phishing attacks**, and how common vulnerabilities can be exploited in different ways. It reinforced the need for strong training, proactive monitoring, and an always-alert mindset.

This module deepened my awareness of how breaches happen, why attackers choose their targets, and the mental discipline needed to respond effectively under pressure ‚Äî like a firefighter responding to a blaze. I‚Äôm starting to see how all of this connects to real-world job responsibilities, and I‚Äôm more motivated to keep building my skills.
